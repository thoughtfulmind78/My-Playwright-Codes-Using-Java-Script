Automated Testing for cherleonardh.wordpress.com

This document describes the automated testing process for the website https://cherleonardh.wordpress.com. The tests focus on verifying the presence of specific elements on the webpage and copying relevant information to the clipboard.

Test Cases:

1. Title Verification:
Objective: Verify that the website title "teacher leonard short blog" is present.
    * Procedure:
        * Navigate to https://cherleonardh.wordpress.com.
        * Locate the website title element.
        * Assert that the title text matches "teacher leonard short blog".
        * If the assertion is successful, copy the title text to the clipboard.
        * If the assertion fails, report the failure.
    * Result:
        * If the title exist, the title is copied to the clipboard and the test is marked as passed.
        * If the title does not exist, the test is marked as failed.

2.  **Article Content Verification:**
    * Objective: Verify that a short article related to "cleaning kitchen with essential tools" is present.
    * Procedure:
        * Navigate to https://cherleonardh.wordpress.com.
        * Locate the article content.
        * Assert that an article containing the phrase "cleaning kitchen with essential tools" is present.

Implementation Notes:

* The automation can be implemented using tools like Selenium, Playwright, or Cypress, which allow for web browser control and element interaction.
* Programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java can be used for scripting the automation.
* Clipboard interaction can be handled by libraries compatible with the chosen programming language and operating system.
* The test results should be reported clearly, indicating whether each test case passed or failed, and providing any relevant error messages.
* For the article content verification, the test should be made robust enough to handle variations in the article's wording or formatting.
* For the clipboard function, ensure that the code has permissions to access the clipboard.
